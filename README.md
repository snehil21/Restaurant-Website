# Restaurant-Website
Welcome to the Basic Restaurant Website repository! This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a simple restaurant website that is not designed to be responsive.

The website is designed to showcase the menu and services offered by the restaurant, as well as provide information about the location and hours of operation.

To get started with the website, you can clone this repository onto your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser. Since the website is not responsive, it may not display correctly on mobile devices or smaller screens.

The repository is organized into several directories, including:

css: This directory contains the CSS code for styling the website.
images: This directory contains the images used on the website.
If you would like to make any changes to the website, you can modify the HTML and CSS files as needed. You can also add your own images or modify the existing ones.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions about the website code, feel free to create a new issue in the repository.

Thank you for using the Basic Restaurant Website repository, and we hope you find it helpful for building your own website!
